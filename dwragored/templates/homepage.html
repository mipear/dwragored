            Are you a cold water swimmer based in South Wales?
            Dŵr Agored (Open Water)
            is a resource for cold water swimmers to share and browse swims, using the All Swims page or scrolling below. 
            As a cold water swimmer myself, I know sometimes it is hard to find the right
            location.

            Navigate to the Location page to add a new location, then "Add A Swim" on the All Swims page.
            Record your swim and share your experiences to enrich the lives of others.
